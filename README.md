# Deep Reinforcement Learning for Smart Factory Optimization

In this work we describe an approach to using reinforcement learning techniques to optimize manufacturing processes. As a case study, the manufacturing system at the Western Digital Corporation facility in San Jose is used to model the factory system examined here. By first building a simulation of the factory system and then applying reinforcement learning techniques to it, reinforcement algorithms involving q-learning, Deep Q-Networks, Policy Gradients and Policy Gradient Search were developed and implemented on the simulation. Results for these methods are compared.
